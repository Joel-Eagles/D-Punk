This is a re-creation of the famous "Atari Punk Console" redesigned not to use any integrated circuits. That means the heart of the original Atari Punk (the 555/556 IC) is missing! In its place are 85 individual components. Not only is this a really fun project to put together, and a beautiful art piece, but it can also be a great intro to digital logic gates, electrical components (passives and transistors), and synthesized music! Please note that the design was made specifically for a black board with clear mask (OSH Park After Dark or similar). so there isn't a ground plane, and traces are much thicker than normal, just because it looks nicer.

The provided Source files are from EasyEDA if you want to explore the design.

**ORDERING**

If you want to order a kit from me I have a Tindie store with more details: https://www.tindie.com/products/32754/

if you would like to save some money, you can order all of the components from the BOM yourself from Digikey and Mouser, and order the board from PCBWay with a HASL finish. My kits come with an ENIG finish (gold plating) which is more expensive.
